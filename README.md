# czarolag's GitLab Profile

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @czarolag. Welcome to my GitLab profile! Here's a bit about me:

- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in AI, Databases, and Web Development.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning about the OpenAI API and deepening my knowledge of Databases.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

1. **DiscordBot Project** - This project focuses on creating a template for a discordbot to integrate with Google Spreadsheets to allow editing using a Service Account to make changes from a discord server.

2. **Wiki-Project** - In this project, I worked with a small team to create a wikipage on the topic of Vacation Spots which allows for account creation and uploads.
   
3. **Animal Classification Project** - In this project, I focused on training a Convolutional Neural Network Model to recognize and classify images out of a set of 15 different animal species.
